A simple, interactive code editor built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This tool allows users to write and preview HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code in real time.

## Demo

## Features

- **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript Support**: Separate text areas to enter HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code.
- **Real-Time Preview**: Instantly renders the code output in a preview window as you type.
- **Responsive Design**: Works well on various screen sizes, providing a comfortable coding experience.

## File Structure

The project is organized as follows:

mini-code-editor/ ├── index.html # Main HTML structure for the code editor interface ├── css/ │ └── styles.css # CSS file for editor styling ├── js/ │ └── script.js # JavaScript for real-time preview functionality └── README.md # Project documentation

bash
Copy code

## Setup and Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/mini-code-editor.git
   cd mini-code-editor
Open the Project
Open the index.html file in a web browser to start using the editor:

bash
Copy code
open index.html
Using the Editor

Type your HTML code in the HTML section.
Write CSS in the CSS section.
Enter JavaScript in the JavaScript section.
The output will display in the Live Preview pane as you type.
Example Usage
Type the following in each section to test the editor:

HTML:

html
Copy code
<h1>Hello, World!</h1>
<p>This is a test paragraph.</p>
CSS:

css
Copy code
h1 {
    color: blue;
    font-size: 2em;
}
p {
    color: gray;
}
JavaScript:

javascript
Copy code
document.querySelector('h1').onclick = () => alert('Hello, World!');
The editor will render a blue "Hello, World!" header with a gray paragraph, and clicking the header will show an alert.

How It Works
The editor updates the live preview with each keystroke:

JavaScript in js/script.js listens for input events on each text area and combines HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code.
The code is dynamically inserted into an iframe for a real-time preview.
Technologies Used
HTML5 for structuring the editor layout.
CSS3 for styling and responsive layout adjustments.
JavaScript for updating the preview pane in real-time.
